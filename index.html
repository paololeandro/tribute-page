      <p>Michael Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone, better known as Sylvester Stallone or also Sly Stallone is an American 
        actor, screenwriter and director, known for his roles in Hollywood action films. Two of his notable characters 
        are boxer Rocky Balboa and soldier John Rambo.</p>
      <h3>Early Life</h1>
      <p>Michael Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone was born in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, 
        on July 6, 1946,[9] the elder son of Francesco "Frank" Stallone Sr., a hairdresser and beautician, and Jacqueline 
        "Jackie" Stallone (n√©e Labofish; born 1921), an astrologer, dancer, and promoter of women's wrestling. His Italian
        father was born in Gioia del Colle, Italy and moved to the U.S. in the 1930s, while his American mother is
        of French (from Brittany) and Ukrainian-Jewish (from Odessa) descent. His younger brother is
        actor and musician Frank Stallone.

        Complications suffered by Stallone's mother during labor forced her obstetricians to use two pairs of forceps during
        his birth; misuse of these forceps accidentally severed a nerve and caused paralysis in parts of Stallone's face.
        As a result, the lower left side of his face is paralyzed (including parts of his lip, tongue, and chin), an 
        accident which gave him his signature snarling look and slurred speech. He was baptized Catholic. His father moved
        the family to Washington, D.C. in the early 1950s to open a beauty school. In 1954, his mother opened a women's 
        gym called Barbella's.[21] Stallone attended Notre Dame Academy and Lincoln High School in Philadelphia, as
        well as Charlotte Hall Military Academy, prior to attending Miami Dade College and the University of Miami.</p>
